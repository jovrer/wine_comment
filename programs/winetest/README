Winetest is a single-executable version of all the DLL conformance
test programs suitable for unattended testing and report submission.
People assigned to build winetest must take care of the following
files, which are only used by 'make dist':

* build.id

Contains a single (either CR or CR-LF) terminated line providing the
build identification.  The accepted characters are [-.0-9a-zA-Z].

* tests.url

Also contains a single terminated line providing the archive URL of
the testing suite being built.

* build.nfo

Contains a block of terminated lines providing miscellaneous
information about the build, like eg. the tools being used.
